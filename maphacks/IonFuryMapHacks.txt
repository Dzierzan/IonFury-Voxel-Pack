1) ABOUT
========
 Maphacks are used to edit the positioning of objects and other parts of Ion 
Fury levels. These maphacks' goal is to improve the compatibility of both the
original game's and user created maps with the Ion Fury Voxel Pack.
 Since there is no central site for map downloads, patching the maps directly
would lead to quite some confusion among players about their respective
versions. By distributing separated maphacks the original map download archives
can be kept unchanged.

What maphacks can do:
 - prevent objects from clipping into walls or each other
   - by rotating them
   - by moving their visible representation (not yet implemented for voxels*)
 - turn the front side of objects to the most likely player position
 - turn off unintended voxel animations
 - prevent wall-aligned decorations from showing up as voxels
 - prevent wall-aligned sprites from flickering (no issue with IF's renderers?)


2) INSTALLATION
===============
 * For the time being, "moving" voxels is only provided by a patched executable
   ('notrans' feature from main branch included), which you can download here:
     https://www.mediafire.com/file/w70bv4yddm2ccos/fury-for-maphacks.7z
   Rename the *.exe of your choice to "fury.exe".

 Technically this is like an IFVP update pack with maphack additions and 
updates only - therefore, if your current IFVP's version number is greater 
than ours, don't use this pack.

a) Unzip this pack into your Ion Fury folder, over the Ion Fury Voxel Pack files

OR

b) Drop this pack into the autoload folder alongside a zipped IFVP, and add the
   line "NoAutoLoad = 0" to the [Setup] section of fury.cfg

OR

c) Standalone invocation: fury -g IonFuryMapHacks.zip -mh maphacks/maphacks.def


 Your fury.log/eduke32.log should contain one or more lines similar to this 
after playing:
   Loaded map hack file "maphacks/usermaps/foobar.mhk"


3) NOTES
========
 The main goal is to get rid of the most annoying IFVP-related problems of 
popular (highly rated by reviewers) and recently released user maps. 
Due to the late introduction of some voxels in the Ion Fury game design, even 
some originals game's maps need some adjustments. 


You can help:

 - If you find anything you consider worthy correcting in an already maphacked
level, don't hesitate to report it (DNCOORDS!), and which renderer/IFVP version
you are using.

 - You can contribute your own maphacks. Basic information is available at:
     https://wiki.eduke32.com/wiki/Maphack_Language

 - If you have a newer version of an already maphacked level, please let LeoD
   know. (But compare the checksums first.)


4) LICENSE
